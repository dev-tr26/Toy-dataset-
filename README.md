# Toy-dataset-
This repository contains implementations of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression on a toy dataset to predict student placement. The model achieves an accuracy score of 90%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting whether a student will be placed based on features like CGPA and IQ. 

# Implementation Details

- Linear Regression: Used for predicting placement probability.
- Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification (placed or not placed).
- Feature Scaling: Standardization is applied to improve model performance.

Results
- Accuracy: ~90%
- Evaluation Metrics: RÂ² Score, MSE, MAE, and RMSE for regression tasks
